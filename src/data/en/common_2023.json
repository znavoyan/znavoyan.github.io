            "abstract": "Consider the exploration in sparse-reward or reward-free environments, such as Montezuma's Revenge. The curiosity-driven paradigm dictates an intuitive technique: At each step, the agent is rewarded for how much the realized outcome differs from their predicted outcome. However, using predictive error as intrinsic motivation is prone to fail in stochastic environments, as the agent may become hopelessly drawn to high-entropy areas of the state-action space, such as a noisy TV. Therefore it is important to distinguish between aspects of world dynamics that are inherently predictable and aspects that are inherently unpredictable: The former should constitute a source of intrinsic reward, whereas the latter should not. In this work, we study a natural solution derived from structural causal models of the world: Our key idea is to learn representations of the future that capture precisely the unpredictable aspects of each outcome -- not any more, not any less -- which we use as additional input for predictions, such that intrinsic rewards do vanish in the limit. First, we propose incorporating such hindsight representations into the agent's model to disentangle 'noise' from 'novelty', yielding Curiosity in Hindsight: a simple and scalable generalization of curiosity that is robust to all types of stochasticity. Second, we implement this framework as a drop-in modification of any prediction-based exploration bonus, and instantiate it for the recently introduced BYOL-Explore algorithm as a prime example, resulting in the noise-robust 'BYOL-Hindsight'. Third, we illustrate its behavior under various stochasticities in a grid world, and find improvements over BYOL-Explore in hard-exploration Atari games with sticky actions. Importantly, we show SOTA results in exploring Montezuma with sticky actions, while preserving performance in the non-sticky setting."

However, backpropagation is only part of the training process. Another key component is data generation, which requires significant CPU power and I/O resources. Having all these components on the same machine may run into the bottlenecks of the system. It then may become necessary to distribute computation, especially data generation, across multiple machines. Distributed computation can also make more efficient use of computational resources; e.g., one can use the leftover CPU power of a training machine to supply data to another training on another machine (or several of them). In this talk, we will outline our approach towards distributed organization of DNN training at Krisp, and particularly, a simple, stand-alone and general distributed framework based on HTTP connections and NFS drive sharing that has helped seamless organization of distributed training and efficient load balancing on our machines. Our framework is not restricted to DNN training only and easily generalizes to more abstract job distribution scenarios across multiple machines and multiple processes."

Without training or fine-tuning, scientific language models could be used for such low-data tasks through their announced zero- and few-shot capabilities. However, their predictive quality at activity prediction is lacking. In this work, we envision a novel type of activity prediction model that is able to adapt to new prediction tasks at inference time, via understanding textual information describing the task. To this end, we propose a new architecture with separate modules for chemical and natural language inputs, and a contrastive pre-training objective on data from large biochemical databases. In extensive experiments, we show that our method CLAMP yields improved predictive performance on few-shot learning benchmarks and zero-shot problems in drug discovery. We attribute the advances of our method to the modularized architecture and to our pre-training objective."

The synthesis of distinct molecular sets unveils complex interplay between generative language modelling and chemical task complexity, shedding light on representations that balance specificity and generality. Furthermore, the training of generative molecular models is facilitated by self supervised training and common language model architectures, which implicitly learn representations which are simultaneously useful for downstream tasks and congruent with the understanding of human experts. To enrich molecular representations, a multimodality approach leveraging pre-trained models with scientific language understanding is being applied in order to create synergy between language models' understanding of real-life scientific experiments and the molecular language."

In this talk, I will first present our recent results towards understanding state-of-the-art deep learning-based visual recognition networks in terms of their robustness and generalizability. Then, I will present our recent work on a video-based conversation model, named Video-ChatGPT, that merges the representational abilities of a pretrained visual encoder and the generative powers of an LLM, capable of understanding and conversing about videos. The proposed approach aims to provide a a unified human-understandable interface to video-related tasks such as action recognition, localization, detection, segmentation, retrieval, and tracking. Our approach adapts the design for spatiotemporal video modeling and fine-tunes the model on video-instruction data to capture temporal dynamics and frame-to-frame consistency relationships available in video data. One of the key contributions of our work is the creation of a dataset of 100,000 video-instruction pairs using a combination of human-assisted and semi-automatic annotation methods. Moreover, we introduce the first quantitative video conversation evaluation framework for benchmarking, allowing for a more accurate evaluation of the performance of video conversation models. Lastly, I will also briefly discuss our ongoing work on developing specialized conversational VLMs for medical imaging domain."

These studies usually use specific datasets that differ in size and parameters, such as patient metadata, number of doctors annotating ECGs, types of devices for ECG recording, data preprocessing techniques, etc. It is well-known that high quality deep neural networks trained on one ECG dataset do not necessarily perform well on another dataset or clinical settings. In this paper, we propose a methodology to improve the quality of heart disease prediction regardless of the dataset by training neural networks on a variety of datasets with further fine-tuning for the specific dataset. To show its applicability, we train different neural networks on a large private dataset TIS containing various ECG records from multiple hospitals and on a relatively small public dataset PTB-XL. We demonstrate that training the networks on a large dataset and fine-tuning it on a small dataset from another source outperforms the networks trained only on one small dataset. We also show how the ability of a deep neural networks to generalize allows to improve classification quality of more diseases."

            "abstract": "Diffusion models have gained immense popularity in recent years due to their impressive ability to generate high-quality images. The opportunities that diffusion models provide are numerous, from text-to-image synthesis to image restoration and enhancement, as well as image compression and inpainting. However, expressing image style in words can be a challenging task, making it difficult for diffusion models to generate images with specific style without additional optimization techniques. In this paper, we present a novel method, Diffusion-Enhanced PatchMatch (DEPM), that leverages Stable Diffusion for style transfer without any finetuning or pretraining. DEPM captures high-level style features while preserving the fine-grained texture details of the original image. By enabling the transfer of arbitrary styles during inference, our approach makes the process more flexible and efficient. Moreover, its optimization-free nature makes it accessible to a wide range of users."

But in this talk, I would like to address the practices and processes that take place before and after building a data engineering solution. To begin with, we will discuss what should be in place before we start to build data pipelines or other solutions, namely, DevOps practices applied to data engineering such as CI/CD and IoC. Then we will focus on monitoring and data quality as post-delivery processes. These are two complementary processes. Not only do we need to make sure that data is flowing through our system but also that it is complete and accurate. Overall, understanding and implementing DevOps practices, monitoring, and data quality in data engineering is crucial for developing and maintaining high-quality data products and platforms."

            "abstract": "Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths among women worldwide. Early detection is critical for effective treatment and improved outcomes.  In this context, thermal imaging has been suggested as a non-invasive, low-risk adjunct screening method for identifying breast cancer. In this study, we present our analyses of thermal imaging data from over 2000 patients who underwent traditional screening methods, including ultrasound, mammography, and biopsy, if needed, at the Erebuni Medical Center. Our analyses employ machine learning algorithms to extract features from the thermal images and evaluate their predictive power in identifying patients at risk of having breast cancer. We find that machine learning-based thermal imaging analysis shows promising results in detecting early breast cancer. We also discuss the challenges and limitations of this approach and suggest future directions for research in this field. Our findings have significant implications for improving breast cancer screening programs, and we believe that machine learning-based thermal imaging analysis can be a valuable addition to existing screening methods for early detection of breast cancer."
