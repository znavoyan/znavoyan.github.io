The recent progress of text-conditioned image synthesis has ushered in a collaborative era where AI empowers users to craft original visual artworks seeking community validation. Nevertheless, assessing these models in the context of collective community preference introduces distinct challenges. Existing evaluation methods predominantly center on limited size user studies guided by image quality and prompt alignment. This work pioneers a paradigm shift, unveiling Social Reward - an innovative reward modeling framework that leverages implicit feedback from social network users engaged in creative editing of generated images. We embark on an extensive journey of dataset curation and refinement, drawing from Picsart: an online visual creation and editing platform, yielding a first million-user-scale dataset of implicit human preferences for user-generated visual art named Picsart Image-Social. Our analysis exposes the shortcomings of current metrics in modeling community creative preference of text-to-image models’ outputs, compelling us to introduce a novel predictive model explicitly tailored to address these limitations. Rigorous quantitative experiments and user study show that our Social Reward model aligns better with social popularity than existing metrics. Furthermore, we utilize Social Reward to fine-tune text-to-image models, yielding images that are more favored by not only Social Reward, but also other established metrics. These findings highlight the relevance and effectiveness of Social Reward in assessing community appreciation for AI-generated artworks, establishing a closer alignment with users’ creative goals: creating popular visual art"

            "abstract": "Most of the current benchmarks evaluate generative LLMs based on the accuracy of the generated output. However, in some scenarios, it is also important to evaluate the recall of the generations, i.e., whether a model can generate all correct outputs. There are two challenges in evaluating recall: the lack of complete sets of correct outputs for any task and the existence of many distinct but similar outputs. In this paper, we propose a benchmark from the domain of small organic molecules. We define sets of molecules of varying complexity and fine-tune language models on a subset of those sets. We attempt to generate as many molecules from the target sets as possible and measure the recall, i.e., the percentage of molecules from the target set that were generated by the model. We examine the impact of the training loss function and sampling strategy on the recall. We propose a sampling strategy based on beam search that avoids duplicates and maximizes recall. Finally, we show that given a small validation set, one can predict the recall of the model without actually generating many samples, which can act as a model selection strategy for maximizing generation recall."

A total of 60,291 compounds were generated, of which 86.5 % displayed superior physicochemical properties compared to oseltamivir. After narrowing down the selection through computational filters, nine compounds with non-sialic acid-like structures were selected for in vitro experiments. We identified two compounds, that effectively inhibited the NAs of both influenza A and B viruses (IAV and IBV), at low micromolar concentrations. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed a similar pattern of interaction with amino acid residues as oseltamivir. In cell-based assays, the 2 compounds inhibited IAV and IBV in a dose-dependent manner with EC50 values ranging from 0.29 μM to 2.31 μM. Furthermore, animal experiments showed that both compounds demonstrated antiviral activity in mice models as well."

In particular, models become better at processing long context windows --- supported context sizes have increased by orders of magnitude over the last few years. However, there is a shortage of benchmarks for code processing that go beyond a single file of context, while the most popular ones are limited to a single method. With this work, we aim to close this gap by introducing Long Code Arena, a suite of six benchmarks for code processing tasks that require project-wide context. These tasks cover different aspects of code processing: library-based code generation, CI builds repair, project-level code completion, commit message generation, bug localization, and module summarization. For each task, we provide a manually verified dataset for testing, an evaluation suite, and open-source baseline solutions based on popular LLMs to showcase the usage of the dataset and to simplify adoption by other researchers. We publish the benchmark page on HuggingFace Spaces with the leaderboard, links to HuggingFace Hub for all the datasets, and link to the GitHub repository with baselines: https://huggingface.co/spaces/JetBrains-Research/long-code-arena."
